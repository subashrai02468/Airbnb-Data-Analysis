Based on the structure of the Jupyter Notebook "Airbnb Data Analysis and Finding Factors Affecting Accommodation Price", I will create a `README.md` file suitable for a GitHub repository:

# Airbnb Data Analysis and Price Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data to uncover insights and build a model to predict accommodation prices. The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that details each step of the process, from data preprocessing to model building.

## Project Overview

1. **Installing and Loading Libraries**: Setting up the environment with necessary libraries for data analysis and modeling.
2. **Loading the Airbnb Listings Dataset**: Importing and understanding the structure of the Airbnb dataset.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Data Visualization**: Analyzing the data to discover patterns, trends, and correlations.
5. **Building the Accommodation Prediction Model**: Developing a predictive model that will show the factors affecting accomodation price.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
The dataset could be downloaded from the link below:
